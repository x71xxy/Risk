Part B (90 marks)



Lovejoy’s Antique Evaluation Web Application



In this part of the coursework, you will develop a secure web application for a local antique dealer named Lovejoy.  Lovejoy wants a minimum viable product allowing customers to register and then request evaluations of potential antique objects.   Lovejoy has many rivals in the antique business who may sometimes resort to underhand tactics and so is very concerned about the security of the application.  

Your secure web application will need to have these features for the minimum viable product (MVP) release: user registration and login, a password policy, “request evaluation” page and then an extension of the “request evaluation” page file upload to allow upload of photos. Finally, Lovejoy needs a request listing page.

You should build Lovejoy’s MVP focusing on the following features in each task.  Mark allocation for each task are as described below and in the security analysis grid.  You should reflect upon your work and provide estimates of how much you’ve achieved by filling out the marking grid. An example of self-reflection is provided in the Canvas. There are thus 30 marks for completing the application reasonably, 50 marks for the security features identified and implemented, and 10 marks for self-reflection and video quality.

You have a choice of technologies from which to build the application:

PHP 

Java 

Python 

No other approach is allowed. If you are using Java and Python, you should research it yourself to find out where you want to host it.  







Submission guidance 

You are only submitting the report to the Canvas. You must follow the report template.

Report -- You must use the report template provided at the end of this coursework description. In your report, you will provide screenshots of all the marking criteria elements and annotate where necessary. In screen shots for the code, please don’t give a big chunk of code, provide only the related lines. Use bullet points to give any explanation, please don’t write big paragraphs. 



Recording -- You will use Sussex Panopto to record a video to show the working of your application and its security features. Useful links provided at the end about Panopto. It is a very straightforward tool to use. You log in using University credential, select the right screen, and record the application to show different features. Show us the aspects that cover marking criteria. Consider the following when recording. 

1) Recording must not be more than 10 minutes. 

2) Must show the testing of all tasks in sequence (features) and its security features

3) Provide voice over or textual application on the video to explain the recording.  

4) Record screen and yourself in the video.

5) Use the self-reflection grid in the task 0 to show the order of recording features.

When you record the video, from the settings, there is a share link button, click on it and select the option that anyone at our organisation who has the link can access the video. Copy that link and put it in your report. 

?





More guidance about recording the video will be provided in the Canvas. 





Code file location (OneDrive)-- Upload your code to the OneDrive and provide the code link in the report for our inspection. 

Select the folder where you have all the code, then click on the share option. In the settings, click on the pencil drop down menu and select the option can edit. Copy the link and put it in your report. 

See the recording on the Canvas how to setup this in a correct way. 

















Report 

You will be submitting this report to the Canvas. The report has 6 tasks. From 1 to 5, it covers the secure application part and the last task 6 covers the AWS. You will provide the three required links below.

Code file Location: --------------------------------------

Upload your code to OneDrive and provide a link here. Set up correct permission so that anyone with a link can view it. 

Panopto recording:------------------------------------------

 If you don’t provide this, we will not be able to test your work fully. 



If any of the above evidence is not provided, you will lose marks as I will not be able to test your application. 

Task 0 – Self-reflection 

Marking grid filled up by you. Fill it up and past it here. We expect you to self-assess yourself fairly.
